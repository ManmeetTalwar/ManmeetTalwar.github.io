          <p>Hi Sharvi,

Hope you are having a good day!! Wishing you a very happy quarantine birthday and loads of happiness and love.

Came across this photo a couple of days back, probably the best memory especially in the last few days of college apart from our numerous fights. Miss your scoldings a lot, had planned a trip to Pune with Vaishali for the birthday before lockdown

Hope to plan a trip and see you soon.
Cheers,
Tanni</p>

          <p>Hi Sharvi. Many many happy returns of the day üéäüéâüíêüéÇ. Have an amazing amazing year ahead and hope all your wishes come true.
I still remember how you knew almost everything and about everyone in our college and even though you had load and loads of friends, you somehow managed to give time to everyone which was just unbelievable .
I miss all 5 of us ( and ofcourse Srishti and Varun as well) hanging out together. Hopefully after Corona let's all plan to meet and hang out together as we used to. Happy birthday once again üéäüéâ.</p>

        <div>Hey Sharr,

You were and you will always be an important part of my life, We have definitely come a long way from that "Attitude waali girl" image of you in 1st sem to my "cutie sadhu" till the date. I will still taunt you in 1000 different ways about whatever little things you do in life, but I will never let them hurt you because i love you for the way you are and that's the reason of our bonding and comfort zone. I will always and always cherish the bond we share, and we will stay in touch with the days like "The Pune Long Drive Day" where we talked our hearts out till late night and we are never going to lose the comfort zone we have around each other. I may annoy you all the time but the only reason I annoy you is because I feel I have that right to annoy you and say that stuff on your face which no one else can. 

Just know that you're precious and special to a lot of people because of the way you're.
Stay the same. Love you.‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
